Slack: Messages in Slack are the preferred method for course communication


### Course Description

This workshop course is designed to give students the skills they need to code for economics, while also providing bits and pieces of information about programming more generally. It’s suitable for complete beginners who have never written any code before. Throughout the course, programming assignments will focus on applications important for applied economists. The course also introduces technical for causal inference.


### Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills

AREC 339, ECON 376, or equivalent economic statistics course
AREC 496/596A


### Course Objectives

1.	Introduce students to coding languages used in economic analysis.
2.	Familiarize students with a specific language.
3.	Apply that language to answer quantitative economic research questions.
4.	Prepare students for job market and graduate school applications.


### Course Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this course, students will be able to:

1.	Demonstrate the ability to analyze data using the coding language of instruction.
2.	Describe key concepts, methods, issues and approaches in applied economics.
3.	Create and communicate comprehension of a programming language.
4.	Apply practical and technical skills such as modelling (abstraction, logic, succinctness), quantitative analysis, and general IT literacy. (Graduate Students Only)


### Instructional Methods

Classes will involve brief introductions to new concepts followed by working on exercises in class that cover that concept. While students are working on exercises the instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material they find confusing, explain misunderstandings and help identify mistakes that are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel applications and alternative approaches to the data analysis challenges students are attempting to solve.


### Required Texts
Turrell, A. 2022. *Coding for Economists*. [https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/)
Huntington-Klain, N. 2022. *The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality*. [https://theeffectbook.net/](https://theeffectbook.net/)

It is highly recommended that students purchase a physical copy of [*The Effect*](https://www.routledge.com/The-Effect-An-Introduction-to-Research-Design-and-Causality/Huntington-Klein/p/book/9781032580227). However, both books are open access and available for free online.


### Required Materials
A laptop computer (not tablet). The University of Arizona Libraries have laptops that can be borrowed: [https://lib.arizona.edu/borrow/tech/laptops](https://lib.arizona.edu/borrow/tech/laptops).


### Assignments
Students are required to read the assigned chapters, complete coding assignments, and take a final exam.

### Replication Project
Graduate students are expected to complete a replication project in which they replicate the results in a published paper. Students will log their work on the [Social Science Reproduction Platform](https://www.socialsciencereproduction.org/).


### Attendance Policy
Attendance will not be taken or factor into the grades for this class. However, experience suggests that students who regularly miss class often struggle to learn the material.


## Grading Policies

The goal of grading in this class is to encourage practice, which is crucial to learning computing skills.
Given that goal grading is based on weekly (equally weighted) assignments, with the focus of each assignment on practicing new material learned each week and reinforcing information learned earlier in the semester.

Because the goal is practice, exercises in assignments will be graded as follows:

* Code runs, uses the requested approach, and produces approximately the correct answer: 100%
* Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept, but does not produce approximately the correct answer or demonstrate basic comfort with the core concept: 50%
* Not submitted or no meaningful effort demonstrated: 0%

Students also enter the class with different levels of experience. The goal of assignments to is help students grow as computational scientists whether they are complete novices or have some limited background in coding. Therefore, on many assignments there are optional *Challenge* exercises that are both more difficult and require integrating all of the weeks material. Students who are already familiar with the basics may choose to submit *Challenge* exercises in place of regular exercises if they wish. One *Challenge* exercise counts for two regular exercises. Alternatively *Challenge* exercises can be completed in addition to all regular exercises for up to 10 pts of extra credit. Please indicate at the top of your assignment if you are substituting *Challenge* exercises.
