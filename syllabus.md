### Course Communications

Slack: Messages in Slack are the preferred method for course communication


### Required Texts

There is no required text book for this class.

All needed material is openly available on the course website. If you are
interested in additional reading on the topics we are covering I highly
recommend [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), which is freely
available on the web.


### Course Description

This workshop course is designed to give students the skills they need to code for economics, while also providing bits and pieces of information about programming more generally. It’s suitable for complete beginners who have never written any code before. Throughout the course, programming assignments will focus on applications important for applied economists. The course also introduces technical for causal inference.


### Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills

AREC 339, ECON 376, or equivalent economic statistics course
AREC 496/596A


### Course Objectives

1.	Introduce students to coding languages used in economic analysis.
2.	Familiarize students with a specific language.
3.	Apply that language to answer quantitative economic research questions.
4.	Prepare students for job market and graduate school applications.


### Course Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this course, students will be able to:

1.	Demonstrate the ability to analyze data using the coding language of instruction.
2.	Describe key concepts, methods, issues and approaches in applied economics.
3.	Create and communicate comprehension of a programming language.
4.	Apply practical and technical skills such as modelling (abstraction, logic, succinctness), quantitative analysis, and general IT literacy. (Graduate Students Only)


### Instructional Methods

Classes will involve brief introductions to new concepts followed by working on exercises in
class that cover that concept. While students are working on exercises the
instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material
they find confusing, explain misunderstandings and help identify mistakes that
are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel
applications and alternative approaches to the data analysis challenges students
are attempting to solve.

## Course Policies

### Attendance Policy

Attendance will not be taken or factor into the grades for this class. However,
experience suggests that students who regularly miss class often struggle to learn the material.


### Quiz/Exam Policy

There are no quizzes or exams in this course.


### Make-up policy

Life happens and therefore there is an automatic grace period of 48 hours for
the submission of late assignments with no need to request an extension.
However, it is highly recommended that you submit assignments on time when
possible because assignments build on one another and it can be hard to catch up
if you fall behind. Reasonable requests for longer extensions will also be granted.
Assignments turned in after the 48 hour grace period without an extension will be
be graded with a 20% penalty.


### Assignment policy

Assignments are due Monday night by 11:59 pm Eastern Time.
This timing allows you to be finished with one week's material before starting the next week's material.
Assignments should be submitted as links to via Canvas.

### Course Technology

Students are required to provide their own laptops and to install free and open
source software on those laptops. Support will be provided by the instructor in
the installation of required software. If you don't have access to a laptop
please contact the instructor and they will do their best to provide you with
one.


### Materials and Supplies Fees

There are no materials and supplies fees for this course.


## UF Policies

Information on UF academic policies, academic resources, and compus health and wellness resources is available on the [Academic Policies & Resources webpage](https://go.ufl.edu/syllabuspolicies).

## Grading Policies

The goal of grading in this class is to encourage practice, which is crucial to learning computing skills.
Given that goal grading is based on weekly (equally weighted) assignments, with the focus of each assignment on practicing new material learned each week and reinforcing information learned earlier in the semester.

Because the goal is practice, exercises in assignments will be graded as follows:

* Code runs, uses the requested approach, and produces approximately the correct answer: 100%
* Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept, but does not produce approximately the correct answer or demonstrate basic comfort with the core concept: 50%
* Not submitted or no meaningful effort demonstrated: 0%

Students also enter the class with different levels of experience.
The goal of assignments to is help students grow as computational scientists whether they are complete novices or have some limited background in coding.
Therefore, on many assignments there are optional *Challenge* exercises that are both more difficult and require integrating all of the weeks material.
Students who are already familiar with the basics may choose to submit *Challenge* exercises in place of regular exercises if they wish.
One *Challenge* exercise counts for two regular exercises.
Alternatively *Challenge* exercises can be completed in addition to all regular exercises for up to 10 pts of extra credit.
Please indicate at the top of your assignment if you are substituting *Challenge* exercises.
