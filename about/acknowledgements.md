## Primary Contributors

Course materials and website design have been primarily developed and
implemented by [Jeffrey D. Michler](https://aaec.arizona.edu/person/jeffrey-d-michler) with help from students in the [Applied International Development Economics (AIDE) Lad](https://aidelab.arizona.edu/).

## Originator

This website and the AAE 497A/597A course structure was built off of [Data Carpentry for Biologists](https://datacarpentry.github.io/semester-biology/) developed and implemented by [Ethan White](http://ethanwhite.org) and [Zachary Brym](http://zackbrym.weecology.org/). That course teaches how to use R so all material (lectures, assignments, etc.) has been developed by [Jeffrey D. Michler](https://aaec.arizona.edu/person/jeffrey-d-michler). 

## Infrastructure

The sute was built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) 
and icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy.
