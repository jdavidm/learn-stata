The inspiration for this course came from a USDA NIFA grant titled "Equitable Agriculture and Environmental Management." The PIs and co-PIs on the grant were Kathy Baylis Geography, UCSB), Sarah Anderson (Bren School, UCSB), Ashley Larsen(Bren School, UCSB), Anna Josephson (Agricultural and Applied Economics, Univ. of Arizona), and Jeffrey D. Michler (Agricultural and Applied Economics, Univ. of Arizona). The stated goal of the grant was to "recruit, support and train 16 underrepresented undergraduate students, 16 underrepresented Masters students and 3 underrepresented PhD students by building STEM-identity. These students will be trained in agricultural issues, quantitative research methods, and career skills using the lens of social justice and equity." It involved bringing undergraduate students from both universities together at UCSB for a two-week intensive workshop in which students learned about agricultural and environmental policy, causal inference, how to code in R, and how to work with ArcGIS. This website grew out of the lessons learned from teaching those workshop and a desire to systematize lessons so they could be scaled by others.

The short-term goal of this site is to provide an intuitive and enjoyable introduction to coding in Stata for students enrolled in AAE 497A/597A: Coding for Applied Economists at the University of Arizona. The course assumed no prior experience with Stata or any other coding language. The only prerequisite is a 300-level econometric or economic statistics course. Basically, the course assumes you know what an OLS regression is.

The long-term goal of this site is to help free-range learners, or folks who aren't taking a formal class and are interested in learning online on their own time. We are starting with the classroom students and then attempting to build on the material generated to make it maximally useful to the broader audience of quantitative social scientists who want to learn how to conduct statistical analysis in Stata. We are interested in helping folks who are complete beginners and those who already have some programming background.
